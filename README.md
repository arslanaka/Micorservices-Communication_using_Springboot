# Micorservices-Communication_using_Springboot

Welcome to the Microservices Communication Project aka SpringLink! This project demonstrates the implementation of microservices in Java Spring Boot, emphasizing synchronous communication between them.

## Overview

In this project, we've created a set of microservices that perform various tasks and communicate with each other synchronously. The main objectives of this project are:

- **Building Microservices**: We've built a set of microservices using Java Spring Boot. Each microservice has its specific purpose and functionality.

- **Synchronous Communication**: All microservices communicate with each other in a synchronous manner, meaning one service sends a request and waits for a response before continuing.

**Please Note**: We are actively working on adding asynchronous communication capabilities to this project in the near future.


## Technologies Used

- Java
- Spring Boot
- WebFlux
- OpenFeign
